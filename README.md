# binaryclock

This package replaces the standard clock in the status area with a binary clock. Configuration options are available 
via the status area menu. Possible options are different styles (binary or BCD) and the 
possibility to hide or show seconds.

Initial Python 2 version by Ruediger Gad, ported to C by Sander.
